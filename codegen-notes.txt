Zynq TODO:

== Software ==
1. malloc: Use mmap instead of aligned alloc, set EXEC permissions
2. memcpy: Use __clear_cache to flush contents to DRAM

== Hardware ==
1. SRAM: Do not register raddr, this is delaying rdata
2. AXI protocol issues:
   1. Keeping addr constant seems to work. Perhaps addr is changing too quickly?
   2. When RVALID is high, only a subset of data are valid. How/why is that?
