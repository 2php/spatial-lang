# Lab 1
In this lab, you will learn about designing apps in Spatial and interacting with hardware peripherals on DE1SoC board.

First, you will need to set up spatial on your computer:

```bash
# To get spatial-lang
git clone https://github.com/stanford-ppl/spatial-lang.git 
cd spatial-lang
git checkout lab1_release
git submodule update --init 
cd ./argon
git checkout lab1_release

# To set up your environment variables
cd ../
source init-env.sh
```

You should verify your environment variables by running:
```bash
echo $SPATIAL_HOME
echo $JAVA_HOME
```
Please verify that you are using Java 8.

To finish the lab, please read [part1](https://github.com/stanford-ppl/spatial-lang/tree/lab1_release/lab1_part1) and [part2](https://github.com/stanford-ppl/spatial-lang/tree/lab1_release/lab1_part2) instructions.
