0. Getting Started
==================

Prerequisites
-------------

First, make sure to download and install the following prerequisites:

- `Scala SBT <http://www.scala-sbt.org>`_
- `Java JDK <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`_
- \[Optional\] `Verilator <https://www.veripool.org/projects/verilator/wiki/Installing>`_ (Required for FPGA simulation only)


While it's not necessarily required, it may be easier to learn to use Spatial if you've had experience with Scala
or a similar functional programming language in the past.

If you'd like, check out a `Scala tutorial <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/scala/>`_ like the one linked here for general info on programming in Scala.


Installation
------------

Next, clone three repositories: `scala-virtualized`, `argon`, and `spatial-lang`.
You can place these anywhere as long as you point your environment variables correctly.
This tutorial will assume you place all three in ${HOME}/spatial.

.. highlight:: bash

Run the following (bash) commands to clone::

    mkdir ${HOME}/spatial
    cd ${HOME}/spatial
    git clone https://github.com/stanford-ppl/spatial-lang.git
    git clone https://github.com/stanford-ppl/argon.git
    git clone https://github.com/stanford-ppl/scala-virtualized.git
    cd scala-virtualized && git fetch && git checkout argon && cd ../ # switch to Argon branch for scala-virtualized
    cd spatial-lang


Note that the current setup requires spatial-lang and argon on the ``master`` branch and scala-virtualized on the ``argon`` branch.

Next, make sure the following environment variables are set.  If you are using the recommended
directory structure in this tutorial, then you can simply run the following command::

    cd ${HOME}/spatial/spatial-lang
    source ./init-env.sh

If you have some other structure, you need to set the following variables manually.
It may be easiest to set them in your terminal startup script (e.g. bashrc) so all future sessions have them::

    export JAVA_HOME = ### Directory Java is installed, usually /usr/bin
    export ARGON_HOME = ### Top directory of argon
    export SPATIAL_HOME = ### Top directory of spatial-lang
    export VIRTUALIZED_HOME = ### Top directory of scala-virtualized

Once these are all set, you are ready to compile the language.  Run the following::

    cd ${SPATIAL_HOME}
    make full

A good habit would be to pull from each of these 3 repositories often and run ``make full`` in ``SPATIAL_HOME``.


That's it! Up next, :doc:`learn how to build a basic Spatial program <helloworld>`.
